Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ This is Westlake Representation Learning Lab, led by Professor [Fajie Yuan](https://fajieyuan.github.io/). 

👩‍💻 We're focusing on two major research directions: 

- Deep learning (for recommender systems)
- AI+Life Science.

🤗 Our lab is now recruiting self-motivated interns / full-time (posdoc/assistant/associate) researchers/ Ph.D. students in machine learning and Life AI.
